Here we created an example to understand Abstract classes.

In this, we implemented three classes as follows

Room
This is an abstract class that has two abstract method named 'buy()' and 'rent()' any class which extends this class needs to implement this abstract method.

Person
This class extends the Room class and implemented the 'buy()' method and 'rent()' method as per the requirements
