# Abstract Class

Here we created an example to understand Abstract classes.

In this, we implemented three classes as follows

### 1.Room
This is an abstract class that has two abstract method named 'buy()' and 'rent()' any class which extends this class needs to implement this abstract method.

### 2.Person
This class extends the Room class and implemented the 'buy()' method and 'rent()' method as per the requirements
