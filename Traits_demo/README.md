# Use Traits
Here we Implement a PHP program in which we are going to use traits

For the implementation of traits, we have defined one trait 'Person' using the Trait keyword, and simply use the 'use' keyword in the class body where we want to use it.

Implementation is done as follows:

1. Person (traits) This is Person trait that contains one method 'boy()'.

2. Ram (class) This is the Ram class which use the Person traits.

3. Jay (class) This is the Jay class which use the Person trait.
