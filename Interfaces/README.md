## Interface Implementation
Here we created an example to understand the Interface.

In this, we implemented One Interface and Two Classes as follows

#Person(Interface)
This is an interface that has two methods 'eat()' and 'marry()' any class which implements this interface needs to implement this abstract method.
#Boys(Class)
This is a class. it implements the person interface and implement the 'eat()' and 'marry()' methods as per requirements.
#Girls(Class)
This is a class. it implements the person interface and implement the 'eat()' and 'marry()' methods as per requirements.
